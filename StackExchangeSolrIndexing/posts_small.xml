Just consider nano-technology alone. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if the dna in his body is badly degraded, you could take bits and pieces of it and then assemble a whole. Using nano-robots you could either have them physically go in and repair each dna strand, and then repair each cell. Or, using the whole dna strand, grow a new body. The real question is the brain. I know the brain cells would all be trashed - destroyed by freezing and then desiccated. But maybe that's not that important, as long as you can still map out the individual connections. I'm not sure how likely that would be since when the cells freeze and dry out, i'm sure some/all of those connections are going to be broken and it might not be possible to piece them back together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to me, his body/dna is almost irrelevant.

It doesn't work that way unless we're talking millions of years. However, if the humans in &lt;em&gt;Waterworld&lt;/em&gt; had genetic engineering, it's perfectly reasonable to believe that they could create a human with gills in 50 years. The long explanation is below, along with a pretty detailed description of how evolution works. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one of the issues in discussing evolution is that we are conflating two different processes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first one is mutations. These pop up in populations at some rate -- which might be different for different species and for different populations. A population which is exposed to high levels of radiation might have a high level of mutation. However, the mutation is random. And many of the mutations will be detrimental -- even to the point of causing large numbers of failed pregnancies. (High rates of miscarriage, or of death during or shortly after pregnancy -- or of unviable eggs in an egg-laying species.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even currently in humans, there is actually a fairly high rate of failed pregnancies. &lt;a href=&quot;http://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-and-parenting/pregnancy/issues/10007-miscarriages-symptoms-causes-treatment.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;15% of known pregnancies&lt;/a&gt; result in miscarriage -- and there are probably even more that we don't know about because they happen before the woman is even aware she's pregnant. Many times, these miscarriages are because the fertilized egg doesn't develop properly, and you don't ever move from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blastocyst&lt;/a&gt; to a fetus. Instead, you get junk which the woman's body disposes of in a miscarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second process is selection. Mutations that are not detrimental enough to cause death will result in new beings. But the ultimate question in terms of evolution is: do these beings reproduce? And will those offspring also reproduce? In natural selection, the environment can determine whether an individual survives long enough to reproduce. Some mutations may affect this process. If a mutation makes an individual fertile for a longer period, they may have more offspring. Similarly, if a mutation ensures that the individual survives longer, that may lead to more offspring. Or if a mutation makes the individual a more attractive parent (long and colorful tails in peacocks, for example), they're more likely to mate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, with humans, there's a mitigating factor. We have tools, which can lead to survival of beings that might not otherwise survive. Take the &lt;em&gt;Waterworld&lt;/em&gt; example: we have boats, and the means to build them. Therefore, in the short term, there wouldn't be any survival pressure to cause any mutation to be beneficial enough to cause a change in the population. In the longer term, however, we'd start running out of ways to fix the boats. It's a lot harder to cut down trees or mine ore if there's no dry land. At this point, the survival of those who can stay off the boats for longer may in fact start to affect the population. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also a question of &quot;unnatural&quot; selection or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;selective breeding&lt;/a&gt;. We can see that in dogs. Wolves look pretty much the same all over the world. But when humans started domesticating canines, we started choosing which males to breed with which females. Therefore, if we wanted particularly small dogs, we breed the smallest males to the smallest females, and in each generation, we continue the process. Eventually, we'll end up with toy dogs, because we're selecting for that feature. (A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/bakewell_robert.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fascinating version&lt;/a&gt; of this process was used in the 1800s to create sheep and cattle with more meat.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most confusing aspects of evolution, however, is the idea that we can evolve a completely new organ (gills) out of nowhere. What mutations do is that they change the blueprint for what is already there. For example, they might enable a slightly higher lung capacity, which would enable people to hold their breath for longer. Over time, if this is beneficial enough, it would spread and perhaps even increase itself even more. But evolution is random. But evolution can't start from scratch. All that can happen is that the current blueprints can be adjusted. So we can start playing with lung capacity, but our genes can't randomly create something that's fully functional right from scratch. For a new organ to evolve would take FAR longer than for a minor change like being able to hold your breath longer to spread. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that matters in natural evolution is whether there is a greater likelihood of producing offspring from that mutation. If yes, then the mutation is selected for. If no, it's selected against. But most mutations have no effect. (A mutation might cause, for example, dimples to appear not just on your cheeks, but also on your elbows.) This is a completely useless mutation in terms of survival. But it might happen to get passed on simply by chance. (Our elbow-dimpled person might also happen to have lots of children.) This is evolution as it normally happens. If a mutation isn't harmful, it is just as likely  to get passed on as not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why in many of the more extreme animal breeds, there are other factors that tend to get passed on along with the trait that has been selected for. (For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thoroughbred&lt;/a&gt; horses, which were bred for speed, tend to have a number of problems including small heart size and bleeding from the lungs.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last factor to consider is a staple of science fiction -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genetic engineering&lt;/a&gt;. This is where we take the DNA sequence to grow X feature and place it into creature Y's DNA. Or where we go into the DNA of an organism and snip out bits that we don't like. This is currently being done in a number of areas. The most common is work being done on crops such as tomatoes or tobacco. (Just do a search for genetically modified food to see a sampling of the range of discussion on the topic.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on when &lt;em&gt;Waterworld&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to take place, that would get my vote for the most likely origin of the gills of Kevin Costner's character. That could theoretically happen in one generation, although there would likely be a number of tries where the genes don't get expressed properly, or they don't work right, or they cause problems for some other system. (I believe the gills were in his neck, which is already chock full of other stuff like the blood vessels leading to the brain -- if the gills interfered with those, the modified baby wouldn't survive.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="69" LastEditorUserId="69" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-01-16T16:18:23.960" LastActivityDate="2011-01-16T16:18:23.960" CommentCount="6" />

The connection was also suggested in a letter in Starlog #160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called &quot;The Preservers&quot;, which Spock had suggested in the original series episode The Paradise Syndrome might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. Coincidentally, in the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (written by Gene Roddenberry), the V'ger entity notes that the Ilia probe is resisting the programming given to it because of residual memories and feelings for Decker, from its precise replication of the Deltan lieutenant. When V'ger becomes aware of this, it decides that &quot;the resistance was futile, of course&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The extra section of the game Star Trek: Legacy contains the &quot;Origin of the Borg&quot;, which tells the story of V'ger being sucked into a black hole. V'ger was found by a race of living machines which gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all carbon-based life an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of V'ger's purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective consciousness. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. However, with thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve V'ger.

Some individual actions have deep effects on future trends. These outliers, regardless if they are mutant or not, are among us. The young unemployed who set himself on fire in Tunis is such an example. Cleopatra, Caesar, Sun Tzu, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, any prophet of any religion, Jeanne d'Arc, Giordano Bruno, Galileo Galilei, Cristoforo Colombo, Gavrilo Princip, Adolf Hitler, Neil Armstrong, Mikahil Gorbachev, are all single individuals, and their actions had deep effects on the resulting history and evolution of the cultural background and events of one or more generations of people.

In fact, if a photon torpedo was fired at a target in close range, the explosion could end up disabling the firing ship in addition to obliterating the target.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Photon torpedoes weren't only ship-to-ship weapons, but served ship-to-ground roles as well.

The real reason for this was because the older series lacked the makeup budget to make them look truly different, but the later series did not have such a restriction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, they ignored the problem, but retconned a reason for it in the prequel series &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;: the Klingons suffered a debilitating malady that caused them to look and act like humans.

Arnold Gillespie, the chief of special effects for Forbidden Planet, came up with the design that everyone liked, according to Arthur Lonergan, after he and Lonergan had sketched and discarded numerous ideas. Gillespie based his design on the shape of the old-fashioned pot-bellied stove. Lonergan turned over Gillespie’s rough design sketches to production illustrator Mentor Huebner, who refined the aesthetic look of the robot (Huebner claims that Robby was his design). &quot;I designed about fifteen of them, and they finally lit on one that was used,&quot; he said. Huebner also mentioned that Gillespie’s early Robby sketch as a refinement of Huebner’s concept. Lonergan, however, remembers that Gillespie originated the idea, and points out the Huebner would refine Gillespie’s ideas, not the other way around. Huebner abandoned Gillespie’s slip cast rubber legs, similar in design and operation to the arms, and hit upon the jointed ball configuration for the robot’s legs. &quot;I thought of having a very short man inside, being able to look out of the stomach, and then have a false head built on him which brings him up to average height,&quot; said Huebner. Gillespie’s concept had the operator’s head inside the robot’s clear plastic dome. Huebner’s changes didn’t alter Gillespie’s basic design, but resulted in the clean lines and well-proportioned appearance that makes Robby so popular and pleasing to the eye.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the end of 1954, the art director, Arthur Lonergan turned Huebner’s work over to Robert Kinoshita, head draftsman of the art department, who would produce the working drawings and blueprints for Robby’s construction under Gillespie’s supervision. With his miniature scale model of Robby approved, Kinoshita began drafting the plans from which the robot would be constructed. Kinoshita’s working drawings were turned over to Jack Gaylord, head of MGM’s Prop Shop, who was in charge of the molding and assembly of Robby’s plastic parts.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_the_Robot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_the_Robot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were 3 units made for the movie, and those 3 were sold to different people.

Within 100 years, war and famine were resolved on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, Gene Roddenberry was most likely a communist. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Addendum:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While Gene Roddenberry had a general idea of where he wanted to go with the Star Trek universe, most likely he did not feature commerce because he was interested in putting pure sci-fi stories on screen (think of some old episodes and how close they are to old pulp sci-fi). So in essence, (and to reconcile with Zypher's excellent answer), we could say that the Star Trek Universe is as much cashless/commerce-less as it is &lt;strong&gt;toilet-less&lt;/strong&gt; (you never see the bathrooms). In other words, it's not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, (most) humans are not driven by the acquisition of goods. Although this was not exactly planned as such by Roddenberry, a look at the rough timeline gives us a clue as to how this change comes about:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2026-2053: &lt;a href=&quot;http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/World_War_III&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World War III&lt;/a&gt; - 600 million dead, many governments destroyed. By that point, we can assume most people were more concerned with day-to-day survival in a somewhat nuclear wasteland.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2063: Zefram Cochrane converts a nuclear missile into the first warp capable, human made vessel, the Phoenix. Him going to warp speed attracts attention of a nearby Vulcan ship, who come down and introduce themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2151: The experimental ship Enterprise begins exploring space beyond the Solar system, after a century of rebuilding humanity, during which famine and war are eradicated.

So, Leto attempts to instill such a hatred of the centralized power structure that's at the heart of humanity's stagnation so humans would do everything in their power to &quot;scatter&quot;: to go to the farthest reaches of the known Universe to avoid being tied to one central authority. This causes the established powers to lose their hold on humanity's progress and future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Scattering has one major additional effect: the development of humanity's ability to avoid prescience, which allows a section of humanity to elude the unforeseen power in the universe that will ultimately destroy them.

So, the science fiction fans began to organize, and became aware of themselves as a movement, a social force; this was probably decisive for the subsequent history of the genre. &lt;strong&gt;He also created the term “science fiction”, though he preferred the term “scientifiction”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Science Fiction Achievement awards, given to various works each year by vote of the members of the World Science Fiction Society, are named the “Hugos.” He was one of 1996's inaugural inductees into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In 1960 he received a special Hugo Award as “The Father of Magazine Science Fiction.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gernsback's &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; obituary &lt;a href=&quot;http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F10F8345C14738DDDA90A94D0405B878AF1D3&quot;&gt;described him as&lt;/a&gt; “the father of modern science fiction.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastActivityDate="2011-01-22T06:07:31.020" CommentCount="2" />

But some form of terrafroming may. The thing about gas giants is that their atmospheres are layered and of varying composition.  Their cores are so high pressure that they are essentially molten. We'd never be able to live down there.  However, many gas giants probably have a layer in their atmosphere that would be the right pressure and temperature for human habitation.  It may not have the right atmosphere composition.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most gas giants have a primarily hydrogen/helium atmosphere.  Mars' atmosphere is primarily CO2. So in the Red, Blue, Green Mars series, what they are doing is causing runaway global warming (releasing more stored CO2) to increase atmospheric pressure and surface temperature. Then they are planting plants to convert the CO2 to O2. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's probably not possible to use similar atmospheric modification techniques to adjust the composition of gas giants. It depends heavily on the composition of the atmosphere at the correct temperature and pressure layer.  There are trace amounts of CO2 and Oxygen.  And since the layers stratify, it's possible that there could be an oxygen layer or a CO2 layer.  They may or may not line up with the correct pressure and temp.  If an oxygen layer does, we're in good shape -- no terraforming required.  If it doesn't or a CO2 layer does, then its likely that it would not be modifiable, because any oxygen created would rise or fall to a different layer. If, by some strange coincidence the oxygen layer is only slightly above or below the CO2 layer, that is the one circumstance where similar techniques could work.  Grow the O2 layer and it will take up the space (maybe) vacated by the CO2.  On the otherhand, if the correct layer is helium or hydrogen, then the techniques used on Mars would not work. Period.  Also, this would require some sort of technology that would allow us to float platforms or airships pretty much indefinitely with out too much energy expenditure at the correct level in the atmosphere.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Venus' case, the problem is the reverse of that on Mars.

But an anthology like that could only be printed when there was already an audience for SF, which is why it came out in 1967, decades after the start of the pulps. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="69" LastActivityDate="2011-01-24T15:45:40.790" />

There are no polar caps to melt.  There's very little atmosphere, so rather than trying to change it, the task would be &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; a suitable one - the &lt;em&gt;Mars&lt;/em&gt; techniques (assuming all the other problems are solved) would probably be useful here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venus: the atmosphere is much more dense than Earth, and it has the same heat issue as Mercury. There is no magnetic field preventing depletion of the atmosphere (i.e. it's constantly replenished), so whatever changes made (e.g. the GEMs, lichen, algae) would be unable to build up, like they did in &lt;em&gt;Mars&lt;/em&gt; (unless an earlier step somehow added a magnetic field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jupiter: it's made up of helium and hydrogen.

There are, however, 63 known satellites, and Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa are similar in many ways to the inner planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturn: much the same as Jupiter (i.e. the &lt;em&gt;Mars&lt;/em&gt; techniques are no use). 62 known satellites; Titan and Enceladus show signs of geological activity but are mostly made of ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uranus: much the same as the other gas giants.

Melting the ice would be a good way to generate &lt;em&gt;oxygen&lt;/em&gt; (theoretically it's dissolved in the ice) - for water there is theoretically an underground saltwater ocean, so that would be a more likely target than the polar caps (especially if the expedition was already working on moholes).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Phobos is destroyed in &lt;em&gt;Red Mars&lt;/em&gt;, which also helps the terraforming (although that wasn't the goal) by adding heat.

There are two technological tracks for this to develop. One is to start experimenting with dead people and steadily refining the process until we can start bringing them back. The ones preserved with the highest level of technology would take the lowest level of repair technology (perhaps none at all), and the lowest tech preservations would take the highest tech to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, this leads to a first-in, last-out scenario with some individuals being reanimated right away, and others (such as today's patients perhaps) taking centuries to be brought back. Regardless of how long it takes, the patient arguably has some kind of moral right to survival despite matching a particular era's criteria for legal death. Many cryonicists only worry about repairing the brain, since the other organs can probably be replaced with sufficient biotech (and there are advances in tissue engineering that make this seem very plausible).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another approach would be to start with hypothermia and hibernation, which are survivable for short periods of time, and slowly work your way to longer and longer periods of time and survival at lower temperatures. This gives empirical evidence at every step, in the form of survival or lack thereof. A form of hibernation that prolongs human life only a few centuries would be a genius invention, as you could most likely use it to survive until true suspended animation, and eventually a comprehensive cure for aging are achieved. Unfortunately, the clinical trials would be so long in duration that it probably would not be a route to the stars for you unless you were a lucky test subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Animal models like the wood frog could prove instructive, but if the procedure were to be perfected in humans it would be likely to involve avoiding freezing altogether, a process called vitrification. This is accomplished in cryonics patients by replacing much of the water of the cells with substances that form glass at low temperatures. The challenge is mitigating and reducing the toxicity of these chemicals. The toxicity level is too high for this to be reversible in brains, but there has been success with rabbit kidneys surviving vitrification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A book that tackles a lot of cryonics issues is &quot;&lt;em&gt;The First Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&quot; by James Halperin, though I'm not sure how far it goes into the technical details.

It didn't have a map or distances or anything -- one of them does, but I don't have the time to find it now -- but it did make this statement:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Even with a well traveled hyperspace&#xA;  route the fastest ships, such as the&#xA;  Millennium Falcon, would take several&#xA;  months to traverse the whole diameter&#xA;  of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere the Galaxy was quoted as being 120,000 light years in diameter.  Using this we can make a really rough guess at how fast the Falcon is, and from that, what the classes really mean.  So we'll assume &quot;several&quot; is 6 months.  Using that we can find that a class 1/2 hyperdrive would travel at about 28 light years per hour.  So a class one's speed is about 14 light years per hour.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll find that map and do a better one later.  I'll note that the book does say that well traveled hyperspace routes, such as trade routes, can take significantly less time than less traveled routes.  Why that would be, I dunno, but it hints that there is more going on to hyperspace than simply traveling faster than light. &lt;strong&gt;[/edit]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="180" LastEditorUserId="2292" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-10-13T01:34:34.480" LastActivityDate="2011-10-13T01:34:34.480" CommentCount="10" />

These are (I believe) available legally for free (because the teams who created the &quot;restored&quot; versions are only allowed to distribute them for free).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Thus there are many early Doctor Who stories which will probably never again see the light of day, since they're unlikely to be rebroadcast, or to be released on DVD.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, most of the &quot;big&quot; episodes from the earlier doctors are available on DVD. These are normally episodes which featured some major villain, like the Daleks or Cybermen.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like David Thomas, I'd recommend &quot;The Beginning&quot; DVD, mostly for historical reasons. Early first Doctor is interesting for knowing the origins of the show, but he's almost unrecognisable even compared to the later first doctor episodes.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for other First Doctor stories, I'd honestly wait off on them until you know you like the style of the earliest Doctor Who stories. Second to Fourth doctors are much more &quot;beginner friendly&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second Doctor has a few &quot;key&quot; stories which I'd highly recommend.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Tomb of the Cybermen features the Cybermen, and is a great story The Cybermen were first introduced in a first doctor story which no longer exists in its entirety, but this is one of their earliest appearances.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Invasion is another Cybermen story, featuring the Cybermen on earth, and is the first story with missing parts to be released on DVD, with the 2 of 8 missing episodes released on the DVD as animations.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The War Games was the final Second Doctor story; and was the first story to mention or show the Time Lords. I'd recommend this one very highly, as it's a great (10-part) story which features the first major details about the Doctor's past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third Doctor and onwards have more DVD releases, simply due to the fact that all episodes from here on still exist in some format.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I'd recommend a few stories here:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The Three Doctors to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Doctor is easily most people's favourite Doctor. Almost any Tom Baker story you pick up will be an excellent watch. Some highlights:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Key to Time (a whole season with an ongoing plot arc), Genesis of the Daleks (a bit of a retcon compared to earlier 1st and 2nd doctor stories, but one of the best Dalek stories), City of Death, and the &quot;New Beginnings&quot; DVD set, containing Keeper of Traken, Logopolis (Fourth Doctor's death) and Castrovalva (first Fifth Doctor story).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are what I'd call the highlights of the first four doctors, and any of them would be great to pick up and get into Classic Doctor Who!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="122" LastActivityDate="2011-01-31T10:01:57.527" />

The bands definitely have an influence on increasing n-space speed but I don't think the books are ever clear on what they are exactly - further dimensions they are transitioning too, likely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gravity waves are stretches of turbulence; I get the impression of a very powerful, fast moving current in the fabric of hyperspace. Grav sails allow the ships to safely be pulled along by the waves at greater speeds than they could normally obtain, while regular impeller drive clashes violently with the wave. The waves are naturally occurring and don't go to all destinations, so there are times when a ship must leave the waves and navigate a calm area to reach the destination (or another wave). The lower speeds during these maneuvers make ambushes more effective, plus ships can sit idle in these areas without active drives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting point I picked up from the stories - it seems no drive power is needed to simply be in hyper -- only for transitioning to or from it, or movement on impeller drive between waves. So a ship could suffer drive damage that would leave it trapped in hyper.

Depending on how you look at it, Ainur are either gods and demigods or something similar to angels; but pantheism, where the Ainur are merely different aspects of Ilúvatar, more closely describes the mythology of Middle Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Ainur are broken into two groups: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Valar&lt;/em&gt;, which consist of the chief agents of Ilúvatar (think the Roman or Greek pantheon), including Lórien, Mandos, Manwë, and Morgoth/Melkor among others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Maiar&lt;/em&gt;, which consist of servants and aides of the Valar (think demi-gods or archangels). The Maiar include figures like Sauron (Morgoth's right hand) and the Istari.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's speculation that he's a &lt;em&gt;Maia&lt;/em&gt;, as he appears to be immortal, isn't a named Vala, and could feasibly be the agent of Yavanna (Vala of nature). However, other Maiar we're exposed to seem to be fully capable of succumbing to the One Ring's power in a way that Tom Bombadil isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other theories include that he's an incarnation of a Vala. However, it's not clear the Valar &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; incarnations: throughout Tolkien's works, Valar, when they want to interact, send agents or interact directly as themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality, Tolkien never defines &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; Tom Bombadil is: not in &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; or in &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&lt;/em&gt;. The closest thing to a definition that Tolkien gives of Tom is that he's extremely old, and simply &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To this end, the third and final theory, that Tom Bombadil is an incarnation of Ilúvatar himself, takes hold. Ilúvatar would definitely not be subject to the corruption of the One Ring, would be far more powerful and older than even the most powerful of the Ainur, and care little for the day-to-day struggles of the mortal and immortal races. Finally, the characteristic that Tom Bombadill simply &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; is similar to how Yahweh, the god of Abraham and Moses, characterizes himself: &lt;em&gt;I am&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it's best not to think of it too deeply. Tolkien was loathe to create allegories and allusions, saying of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. [...] &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.

In Phantom Menace, the Republic was functioning as normal and so a child of 9 would definitely be considered too old to begin training, for the reasons Qui-Gon gave. At this stage the age limit is a matter of bureaucracy more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Empire Strikes Back, the Republic has long fallen, and Yoda is essentially the only Jedi left alive. The reasons he gives Luke before mentioning his age are essentially the reasons they didn't take in older children during the time of the Republic.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I suspect that in Empire, Yoda is deliberately trying to put off Luke, to test his determination. He knows full well who Luke's father is, and that he would make a very powerful Jedi based on his midichlorian count. I suspect he rejects Luke initially more to check how Luke deals with rejection than anything else. If Luke had gotten angry or violent, Yoda would have rejected his training for that reason; but instead Luke manages to convince Yoda that he is &quot;righteous&quot; enough to be Yoda's last chance at keeping the Jedi order going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="122" LastEditorUserId="678" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-02-04T12:31:10.393" LastActivityDate="2011-02-04T12:31:10.393" CommentCount="3" />

If I remember correctly, the order for what I consider the &quot;main series&quot; is &quot;revelation space&quot;, &quot;redemption ark&quot;, and &quot;absolution gap&quot;. Absolution pretty much ends the story, if I remember correctly. Though he could always continue - Peter Hamilton pulled this trick very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chasm city takes place separately (and is a great book otherwise) and I found it enjoyable after Revelation Space where I already knew what happens to the band. Then I read Diamond Dogs (short story) which relates to Chasm City. There are also related stories in Galactic North.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Prefect takes place in the glitter band earlier, and just mentions something bad happening in the future (the conjoiners appear in that book as well). I read it later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds' other books are each standalone in a different universie - Century Rain is about alternate worlds, Pushing Ice is close-to-modern-day and seems like a Rama tribute. House of suns is weaker and plays with extremely long periods of time (galaxy spanning). Terminal World talks about an earth in the future with &quot;Zones&quot; (a-la Vernor Vinge).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your second question - The Melding Plague is the name of the transformation. The Rust belt is what happens to the glitter band after the plague. You won't get a good idea of what happened - Just of life before and after. Reynolds makes these places seem &quot;alive&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="384" LastActivityDate="2011-02-12T01:57:17.540" CommentCount="1" />

The old scale was calculated based on &quot;observed&quot; speed (much like our MPH/KPH), but the amounts of energy needed to maintain that speed could be vastly different from one moment to the next based on interstellar conditions and quantum drag forces.  For instance you spend a few seconds traveling through a smallish eddy and it greatly reduces your velocity.  Since such great distances were being covered in such a short time, a great deal of turbulence exists.  Since the engines aren't actually fluctuating power to maintain a constant speed, the observed (averaged) speed was little more than a guess.  I imagine this like driving a car at 6000 RPM over a surface that is at one second oil and the next sandpaper, with large rocks mixed in here or there.  You could certainly figure out what your speed was for the last mile, but it may not be indicative of your speed for the next mile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In TNG, the scale was changed to the amount of power required to transition from one warp plateau to another. The idea here is that it's easy (power-wise) to maintain a particular speed, but a power spike is needed to make that jump from Warp 1 to Warp 2.  A larger spike is needed to get from Warp 1 to Warp 9.  At that time, they decided Warp 10 was infinite power required.  So all the &quot;undiscovered&quot; plateaus between 9 and 10 had to be squeezed in.  I liken this to the metric system, where they decide a gram was a rather small amount of mass, but rather than recalibrate, people just decided to measure things in kgs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of canon, I recall an interview with Roddenberry.  He put in a speed limit to keep writers from inventing more speed as the way out of trouble.  You can see this a few times in the first season where the Enterprise tries to outrun things, but cannot (Qs grid springs to mind).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;:  Just found online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/17602666/Star-Trek-TNG-Technical-Manual-182-Pages&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the TNG Technical Manual with a note alluding to Gene's decision.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Figuring out how &quot;fast&quot; various warp&#xA;  speeds are was pretty complicated, but&#xA;  not just from a &quot;scientific&quot;&#xA;  viewpoint. First, we had to satisfy&#xA;  the general fan expectation that the&#xA;  new ship was significantly faster than&#xA;  the original. Second, we had to work&#xA;  with Gene's recalibration, which put&#xA;  Warp 10 the absolute top of the&#xA;  scale. These first two constraints are&#xA;  fairly simple, but we quickly&#xA;  discovered that it was easy to make&#xA;  warp speeds TOO fast. Beyond a certain&#xA;  speed, we found that the ship would be&#xA;  able to cross the entire galaxy within&#xA;  a matter of just a few months. (Having&#xA;  the ship too fast would make the&#xA;  galaxy too small a place for the Star&#xA;  Trek format.) Finally, we had to&#xA;  provide some loophole for various&#xA;  powerful aliens like Q, who have a&#xA;  knack for tossing the ship millions of&#xA;  light years in the time of a&#xA;  commercial break. Our solution was to&#xA;  redraw the warp curve so that the&#xA;  exponent of the warp factor increases&#xA;  gradually, then sharply as you&#xA;  approach Warp 10. At Warp 10, the&#xA;  exponent (and the speed) would be&#xA;  infinite, so you could never reach&#xA;  this value. (Mike used an Excel&#xA;  spreadsheet to calculate the speeds&#xA;  and times.) This lets Q and his&#xA;  friends have fun in the 9.9999+ range,&#xA;  but also lets our ship travel slowly&#xA;  enough to keep the galaxy a big place,&#xA;  and meets the other criteria. (By the&#xA;  way, we estimate that in &quot;Where No One&#xA;  Has Gone Before&quot; the Traveler was&#xA;  probably propelling the Enterprise at&#xA;  about Warp 9.9999999996. Good thing&#xA;  they were in the carpool lane.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="326" LastEditorUserId="326" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-02-15T13:03:46.110" LastActivityDate="2011-02-15T13:03:46.110" CommentCount="3" />

However, this rarely happened, and as synthetic crystals demonstrated a slightly lower amount of maneuverability, this advantage was very slim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Around 4,000 BBY, lightsaber crystals were used to indicate a Jedi's chosen class. &lt;strong&gt;Blue indicated a Jedi Guardian&lt;/strong&gt;, a Jedi who used the Force on a more physical level. &lt;strong&gt;Green indicated a Jedi Consular&lt;/strong&gt;, a Jedi who preferred to reflect on the mysteries of the Force and fight the dark side at its heart. &lt;strong&gt;Yellow indicated a Jedi Sentinel&lt;/strong&gt;, a Jedi who honed their skills in a balance of combat and scholarly pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This distinction fell out of practice in later years when most Jedi used blue or green crystals&lt;/strong&gt;, based on the supply on the various source worlds. Purple, yellow, and orange crystals were still used by some Jedi until the the fall of the Jedi Order, but they were exceedingly rare, and often passed down through generations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For millennia, the Jedi Order lit lightsabers in every color and hue imaginable. However, following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Ruusan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Battle of Ruusan&lt;/a&gt;, the hues of most available crystals had been limited to either blue or green.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the out of universe section, this quote is taken form &lt;a href=&quot;http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber#Colors&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lightsaber Entry, Behind the scenes - Color section on Wookieepedia&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Lightsabers depicted in the first two released films, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). &lt;strong&gt;This color difference was a decision during post-production when the lightsaber blades were being rotoscoped, as the original blades were simply white.&lt;/strong&gt; In Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker's newly-constructed lightsaber was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters, but in the final film, &lt;strong&gt;it was ultimately colored green in order to better stand out against the blue sky of Tatooine in outdoor scenes&lt;/strong&gt;.

The series examines the impact of scientific changes (e.g. the societal impact of human diaspora to other planets, the moral implications of genetic manipulation, how language is likely to change when humans are spread over multiple planets, the economic reality of limited-resource space travel) as well as having space ships and planets with multiple moons.  Most of the science falls under the social sciences (still science!), rather than physical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asimov's stories are likewise not just detective stories set in space.

Not time cops in the sense of going after law breakers.  The intent was to maintain a policy of non-interference as much as possible but when interference was warranted then to make the least possible change and to do so invisibly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, they might take someone's keys off the dresser and put them just out of sight underneath the dresser where they plausibly might have fallen.

If the light was extinguished that would be very bad (exactly how we are not told). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also an implication that the light could be misused in some way (or perhaps people seeking to do so might accidentally damage it, much as it was damaged by Jacob). As such, the island needed to be protected against these people. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, something being dangerous does not mean that people will stay away from it (in real life or in &lt;em&gt;LOST&lt;/em&gt;). In fact, the opposite is likely to be true, especially when the danger arises from some sort if power. The Dharma Initiative is a good example of this - although there was danger on the island, they were very eager to investigate it further (presumably with good intention). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exactly what the protector could do wasn't established. However, it seems that they could set their own rules to an extent (see closing dialogue between Hugo and Ben). In Jacob's case, he could influence people outside the island such that their lives were altered (ending up on the island), and he could set constraints on the MiB/Smokey. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We only see a tiny proportion of the time that Jacob was protector, almost none of Hugo's time or Jacob's mother's time, and Jack is protector only for a very short period. That means that we don't really know what the protector is capable of, or what they have needed to do to protect the island/light. Most of our experience with Jacob is tied to his finding a successor and a resolution to his mistake with MiB/Smokey - in fact Smokey influences his time as protector extremely, and so earlier/later protectors probably behaved very differently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2011-02-18T09:52:21.703" CommentCount="1" />
